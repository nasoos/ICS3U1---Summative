# room.py
# contains the room class that contains the obstacles and water coordinates, if it was visited or not, room number, fish and enemy placements, and the image

# input: arguments for parameters defined by functions, this includes int, list, and pygame surfaces
# output: transition function returns the doorNum and nextRoom Num as an int
